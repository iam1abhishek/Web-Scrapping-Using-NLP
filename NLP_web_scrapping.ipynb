It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and geographical bias against the Global South (Eurocentrism).[9][10][failed verification] While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise in the late 2010s and early 2020s,[3][9][11] having become an important fact-checking site.[12][13]\\n', 'Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site.[14][15] Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for frequently updated information about those events.[16][17]\\n', 'Various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success.[18] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[19] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[1][20] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.[W 2] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[21][W 3] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[W 4] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.[W 5]\\n', 'The domains wikipedia.org and wikipedia.com (later redirecting to wikipedia.org) were registered on January 13, 2001,[W 6] and January 12, 2001,[W 7] respectively.

Soon after, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue.[208] The Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.[W 115][W 116] The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.[W 117]\\n\", 'Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service.[W 103] In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices, or WebOS-based devices.[W 118] Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata like geoinformation.[242][243]\\n', 'Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access.[W 119][244] It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators.[W 119]\\n', \"Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors.[245][246] Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years,[245] and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.[37] Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.[245][246]\\n\", 'Access to the Chinese Wikipedia has been blocked in mainland China since May 2015.[15][247][248] This was done after Wikipedia started to use HTTPS encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult.[249]\\n', 'Russians have developed clones called Runiversalis[250] and Ruwiki.[251]\\nIranians have created a new website called wikisa.org.[W 120]\\n', 'In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.[12][13] Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, \"YouTube\\'s reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out \\'fake news\\'.\"[13][252]\\n', 'In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating \"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month,\\xa0... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.\"[7] However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.[253] The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.[254]\\n', 'In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,[W 121] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.[255] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365\\xa0million at the end of 2009.[W 122] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.[256] In 2011, Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4\\xa0billion if it ran advertisements.[257]\\n', 'According to \"Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011\", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.[W 123]\\n', 'As of February\\xa02023,[update] Wikipedia attracts around 2\\xa0billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10\\xa0billion pageviews each month.[W 1]\\n', 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia\\'s coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall.[258][259][260][261] Noam Cohen wrote in Wired that Wikipedia\\'s effort to combat misinformation related to the pandemic was different from other major websites, opining, \"Unless Twitter, Facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet.\"[259] In October 2020, the World Health Organization announced they were freely licensing its infographics and other materials on Wikimedia projects.[262] There were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different Wikipedias, as of November\\xa02021.[update][263][264]\\n', 'Wikipedia\\'s content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.[W 124][265][266] The Parliament of Canada\\'s website refers to Wikipedia\\'s article on same-sex marriage in the \"related links\" section of its \"further reading\" list for the Civil Marriage Act.[267] The encyclopedia\\'s assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization[268]—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.[269] Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports.[270] In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia.[271]\\n', 'Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,[272][273] often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.[274][275][276][277]\\n', 'In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia\\'s participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and Facebook) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.[278] On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: \"Type a candidate\\'s name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\"[279] An October 2007 Reuters article, titled \"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one\\'s notability.[280]\\n', 'One of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on September 28, 2007, when Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, \"the seventh most consulted website\", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.[281]\\n', 'A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford-based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report called Wikipedia \"the best-known example of crowdsourcing\\xa0... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth\".[282][283]\\n', 'In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as \"one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web\" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having \"since colonized the web for television\\'s values\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia\\'s goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\". Rather than \"sapere aude\" (lit.\\u2009\\'dare to know\\'), social networks have led to a culture of \"dare not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\"[284]\\n', 'Wikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004.[W 125] The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges\\' Webby Award for the \"community\" category.[285]\\n', 'In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question \"Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?\"[286]\\n', 'In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling, and Peter Gabriel. The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger.[287]\\n', 'In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences,[288] and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation.[289] Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian Wikipedia users.[290]\\n', \"Many parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.\\n\", 'Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning \"together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on\".[154] Another example can be found in \"Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence\", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion,[291] as well as the 2010 The Onion article \"\\'L.A. Law\\' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today\".[292]\\n', \"In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy The Office, office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.[293] Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.[294]\\n\", '\"My Number One Doctor\", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide.[295]\\n', 'In 2008, the comedy website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named \"Professor Wikipedia\", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.[296]\\n', 'The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying \"Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.\"[297]\\n', 'In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia.[298] Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.[299]\\n', 'On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: \"Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?\"[300] The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier who had recently come out as a trans woman.[301]\\n', 'In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia \"at least a dozen times a day\", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as \"a work of reference as useful as any in existence\", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it.[302]\\n', 'Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002,[W 126] Wikiquote, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched,[303] Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts,[W 127] Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia,[W 128] Wikinews, for collaborative journalism,[W 129] and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.[W 130] Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalog of all species, but is not open for public editing.[304] In 2012, Wikivoyage, an editable travel guide,[305] and Wikidata, an editable knowledge base, launched.[W 131]\\n', 'The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.[306][307][308] Nicholas Carr\\'s 2005 essay \"The amorality of Web 2.0\" criticizes websites with user-generated content (like Wikipedia) for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers\\' going out of business, because \"free trumps quality all the time\". Carr wrote, \"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can\\'t imagine anything more frightening.\"[309] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of Wired, wrote in Nature that the \"wisdom of crowds\" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with rigorous peer review processes.[310]\\n', 'Wikipedia\\'s influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen BookScan stated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping \"far more sharply\".[311] Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of two biographies wrote, \"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what\\'s left for biography?\"[311]\\n', 'Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing.[312][313] In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called \"wikification\",[314] and to the related problem of word-sense disambiguation.[315] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find \"missing\" links in Wikipedia.[316]\\n', 'In 2015, French researchers José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.[317][318][319] They used PageRank, CheiRank and similar algorithms \"followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)\".[319][320] The study was updated in 2019.[321]\\n', 'A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications.[322][323]\\n', 'Studies related to Wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence[283] to support various operations. One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism[324][325] and data quality assessment in Wikipedia.[326][327]\\n', \"In February 2022, civil servants from the UK's Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities were found to have used Wikipedia for research in the drafting of the Levelling Up White Paper after journalists at The Independent noted that parts of the document had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on Constantinople and the list of largest cities throughout history.[328]\\n\", 'Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.[329]\\n', 'Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2),[330] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).[W 132] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.[331]\\n', 'Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium.[332][333] The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create
